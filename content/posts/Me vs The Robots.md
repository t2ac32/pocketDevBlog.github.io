This is the first post of an *idea throwing* blog. 

I decided to start this blog as a way to document small findings on my journey understanding how to work with A.I and trying to keep up to date. 

At the same time I hope this helps to anyone trying to get the hang of vibe coding and surviving the tech industry in trying times. 

*To whomever reads this..* 
Feel free to have questions and challenge anything I write here i'm learning.

Feel free to contact me on any of my social networks I will try to read,  answer and listen as soon as possible.

*To my self...*

       Good luck!
